Your task is to:

* Write cypress tests for as many scenarios you can come up with.
* Add spec to `my-spec.cy.js` file in `/e2e` folder.
* Feel free to move test logic to `/support` folder.
* add this project to your git account and share the link with us - Make sure you do **NOT** include `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`
